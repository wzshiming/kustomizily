# Kustomizily

Kustomizily is a CLI tool that transforms Kubernetes YAML manifests into a structured Kustomize directory layout, enabling better resource management and customization.

## Motivation

Deconstructs monolithic YAML files generated by `helm template` into manageable components

## Key Features

- **Lossless Bidirectional Conversion**
  - Guarantees equivalence: Source YAML = kustomize build ( Kustomizily ( Source YAML ) )
  - Maintains full fidelity of original YAML files including comments, labels and annotations

- **Intelligent Resource Organization**
  - Groups resources into directories based on annotations for improved organization
  - Creates concise, unique filenames to ensure clarity and prevent naming conflicts
  - Transforms ConfigMaps and Secrets into Kustomize generators for better content management
  - Organizes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) in a dedicated `crd` directory following KubeBuilder practices

## Usage

``` log
Usage of kustomizily:
  -d    Dry run mode
  -i string
        Input k8s YAML file (default "-")
  -o string
        Output directory (default "./kustomizily")
```
